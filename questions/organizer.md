## Question

Welcome to **The event**! Here is the problem statement:

You are the organizer of an event, and you are handed the following list of people's ages for activites later:
```python
ages = [42, 17, 65, 32, 47, 76, 5, 13]
```
As the organizer, you must separate the group into three. Children under 18 and adults over 50 need to be in respective groups, and there must be a thrid group for all in between.
In order to be an efficient organizer, you need to take two steps in order to complete this task.
 - First, you must sort the list so that the ages are displayed in ascending order
 - Second, you must split the list into the three age groups

Write a function(s) that will take in the list as an argument and then return the updated lists.

Sample solution:
```python
def listFunc(ages):
    # make a loop that will fully sort through the loop

    # use another method in order to split the list into three

    # I wasnt able to finish the code lol
```
