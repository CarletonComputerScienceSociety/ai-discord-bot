Write a program that initialize an empty list, then populate the list with 20 random integers from 1 to 99. Then write a function to sort those integers in ascending order. Print the result after each step.

Sample:

my_list after generate random numbers = [3, 7, 99, 50, 77, 52, 22, 76, 55, 42, 80, 77, 63, 45, 44, 74, 96, 33, 11]

my_list after sorted = [3, 7, 11, 22, 33, 42, 44, 45, 50, 52, 55, 63, 74, 76, 77, 77, 80, 96, 99]
