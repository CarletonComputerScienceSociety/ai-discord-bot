# Questions for students

## How it should work

We are going to ask students questions about coding ideas. We'll start with a
simple one.

*Discord bot*
> What is a python list?? 

*Student*
> A python list can hold a bunch of values. They can be any type of values.
> They can be strings, numbers, or even other lists.  You can use them for anything.

The bot will then have a list of criterias for what should be considered good.
This still consist of bullet-point facts.

- A Python list can hold any value A
- A python list is mutable
- It can be used for many things, but there are reasons not to use it.

<!-- TODO: We should look at if we can get this list generated by ChatGPT -->

The bot will then respond with a score. The score will be based on how many of
the criterias the student got right.

*Discord bot*
> You got 2 out of 3 points. You got the first two points right, but you missed
> the last one. You said that a list can be used for anything, but there are
> reasons not to use it. Can you think of any reasons not to use a list?

The bot should give feedback that is relevant to its list of facts. It should
try to educate on any missed points, or correct anything that was wrong.
